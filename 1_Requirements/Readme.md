## Introduction
### Tic Tac Toe
          You have probably played the Tic-Tac-Toe game to pass time during school hours.
          It’s fun when you play with paper and pencil.
          Here, we have developed a mini project in C Tic Tac Toe game – a simple console application without graphics.
# Research
         Tic Tac Toe is a zero-sum and perfect information game. 
         It means that each participant's gain is equal to the other participants' losses and we know everything about the current game state.
         In a two-player (A vs B) game, if player A scores x points (utility units), player B loses x points.
## Winning Strategy
         Unfortunately, there is no way to guarantee that a player will win every single game of tic tac toe they play. Victory, defeat, or a draw is determined by the interaction of both players.
         If both players operate perfectly, a draw will always occur
