## Introduction
### Tic Tac Toe
          You have probably played the Tic-Tac-Toe game to pass time during school hours.
          It’s fun when you play with paper and pencil.
          Here, we have developed a mini project in C Tic Tac Toe game – a simple console application without graphics.
# Research
         Tic Tac Toe is a zero-sum and perfect information game. 
         It means that each participant's gain is equal to the other participants' losses and we know everything about the current game state.
         In a two-player (A vs B) game, if player A scores x points (utility units), player B loses x points.
## Winning Strategy
         Unfortunately, there is no way to guarantee that a player will win every single game of tic tac toe they play. Victory, defeat, or a draw is determined by the interaction of both players.
         If both players operate perfectly, a draw will always occur
# Cost and Features and Timeline
## General Order Of Steps To Implement
       1. Create a Tic Tac Toe board and fill it with dashes.
       2. Create a function that draws the board like a square.
       3.Keep track of the player's turn and what symbol they are using.
       4.Keep asking the user to enter a row and col until they are valid.
### Features
       1.The game is played on a grid that's 3 squares by 3 squares.
       2.You are X, your friend (or the computer in this case) is O. Players take turns putting their marks in empty squares.
       3.The first player to get 3 of her marks in a row (up, down, across, or diagonally) is the winner.
       4.When all 9 squares are full, the game is over.
#### Timeline
       Games played on three-in-a-row boards can be traced back to ancient Egypt, where such game boards have been found on roofing tiles dating from around 1300 BC.
       An early variation of tic-tac-toe was played in the Roman Empire, around the first century BC.

# 4W's and 1'H
## WHO
     Anyone who gets stressed and childers during fun hours can play the game to have some relaxation.
### WHAT
     This project is concerned about developing a game which makes us to think logically to win the game.
#### WHEN
     The children are encouraged to think more logically. They, naturally develop their logical-mathematical thinking, which can help them in subjects such as math and engineering in the future.
##### WHY
     As this project uses C programming language it can be easy to understand the logic.
###### HOW
     Implemented using Functions , loops and other functionalities of C.
# Detail requirements
## High Level Requirements:
### Windows
• MinGW ("Minimalist GNU for Windows"), formerly mingw32, is a free and open source software development environment to create Microsoft Windows applications. MinGW can be run either on the native Microsoft Windows platform, cross-hosted on Linux (or other Unix), or "cross-native" on Cygwin.
* MinGW includes a port of the GNU Compiler Collection (GCC), GNU Binutils for Windows (assembler, linker, archive manager), a set of freely distributable Windows specific header files and static import libraries which enable the use of the Windows API, a Windows native build of the GNU Project's GNU Debugger, and miscellaneous utilities.
• Vscode : Visual Studio Code is an integrated development environment made by Microsoft for Windows, Linux and macOS. Features include support for debugging, syntax highlighting, intelligent code completion, snippets, code refactoring, and embedded Git.
• Doxygen, Makefile, dot(.) run extentions
* documentation generator and static analysis tool for software source trees. ... Doxygen can cross reference documentation and code, so that the reader of a document can easily refer to the actual code.
* Makefile is used to run multiplefiles as one file.
• Able to run in both Linux and Windows
• Programming language: C Programming
## Low level Requirements:
     Tic-tac-toe is a game in which two players take turns in drawing either an ' O' or an ' X' in one square of a grid consisting of nine squares. The winner is the first player ### to get three of the same symbols in a row.
a game in which two players alternately put Xs and Os in compartments of a figure formed by two vertical lines crossing two horizontal lines and each tries to get a row of ### three Xs or three Os before the opponent does.
